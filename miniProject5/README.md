##Mini-project # 5 - Memory

In this Memory game, there are 16 cards lying face-down. Numbers range distinctly from 0 to 8 and each number occurs in a pair. Player flips open two cards in a move. If the two cards are the same, the two cards continue lying face-up. If the two cards are not the same, those two cards are flipped face-down again and the game continues.
