##Mini-project #8 - RiceRocks (Asteroids)

At the end of this project, your game will have multiple rocks and multiple missiles.  You will lose a life if your ship collides with a rock and you will score points if your missile collides with a rock. You will keep track of the score and lives remaining and end the game at the proper time.
