## CourseraPython
I took this course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" on Coursera in 2014, taught by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, Stephen Wong. This repository contains all my mini-projects in this course.

To run each mini project, first copy and paste the python code in each mini project folder to http://www.codeskulptor.org/ <br/>
Then run the code.

I obtained a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.
